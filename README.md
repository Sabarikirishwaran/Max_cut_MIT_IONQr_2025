# Max Cut Problem Solution

Solution to IonQ's challenge at MIT IQuhack 2025 

## Overview
This project provides a solution for the **Max Cut Problem**, a fundamental problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. The goal of the Max Cut problem is to partition the vertices of a given graph into two subsets such that the number (or total weight) of edges between the two subsets is maximized.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an approach to solve the IonQ's challenge, heuristic methods and quantum computing techniques.

## Contents
- Implementation of the **Max Cut** problem solution.
- Graph representation and visualization.
- Algorithms used for solving the problem.
- Performance analysis and results.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sabrikirishwaran/max-cut-solution.git
   cd max-cut-solution
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open **Max_cut_solution.ipynb** and run the cells.
